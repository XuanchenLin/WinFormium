                <h3>Welcome to D.Va's Security Console</h3>
                <p>Hi, I’m D.Va—real name Hana Song! Before I became a mech pilot, I was a professional gamer in South Korea, dominating the leaderboards and earning a reputation for my lightning-fast reflexes and sharp mind. My journey from the world of eSports to the battlefield was unexpected, but I’ve always thrived under pressure and loved a good challenge.</p>
                <p>Now, I serve as a pilot in the Mobile Exo-Force of the Korean Army, also known as MEKA. My mech is my second home, equipped with Fusion Cannons, Defense Matrix, and Boosters. I use my skills to protect my country and my teammates, always staying one step ahead of the enemy. My playstyle is all about mobility and aggressive tactics—I’m never afraid to dive into the action!</p>
                <p>One of my favorite tools is the Defense Matrix. With it, I can nullify incoming projectiles and shield my allies from harm. It takes perfect timing and quick decision-making, but that’s what I’m best at. My Boosters let me fly across the battlefield, making sure I’m always where my team needs me most—whether it’s contesting an objective or chasing down a threat.</p>
                <p>Of course, everyone knows me for my ultimate move: Self-Destruct! When the situation gets tough, I eject from my mech and send it exploding into the enemy ranks, dealing massive damage. It’s risky, but the thrill of turning the tide of battle in an instant is what I live for. There’s nothing quite like hearing the enemy scatter when they hear, “Nerf this!”</p>
                <p>Outside of combat, I’m still a gamer at heart. I love streaming my matches and sharing my experiences with fans all over the world. My community means everything to me—they inspire me to keep pushing my limits and never give up, no matter how tough things get. I want to be a symbol of hope and determination, showing everyone that with courage and teamwork, anything is possible.</p>
                <p>So whether I’m piloting my mech on the front lines or connecting with fans online, I always give it my all. After all, I’m not just fighting for myself—I’m fighting for everyone who believes in me. GG!</p>
